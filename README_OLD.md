## Workflow

Use Node.js scripts to run build tools.

* `$ npm start` - Start development server with live reload.
* `$ npm run watch` - Recompiles files whenever they change.
* `$ npm run build` - Creates production ready code.

After running `` $ npm run watch `` or `` $ npm run build ``, your deploy-ready code will be taken from the ``./src/`` directory and placed within the ``./public/build/`` directory of your project. However, the webpack generated templates will be placed within the ``./public/static/templates/_webpack.templates`` directory of your project so Craft CMS has access to them.

* [BEM](http://getbem.com/) -  Block Element Modifier is a methodology, that helps you to achieve reusable components and code sharing in the front-end
